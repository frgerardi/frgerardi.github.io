        <p>
            Hi, welcome to my page! I just started my career as a Data Scientist, after gaining a PhD in Astrophysics at University College London, 
            working on inferring cosmological parameters using Bayesian and Machine Learning techniques. My experience up to now is mostly 
            academic, but my interests for novel ML techniques go beyond! <br>
            During my time in London, I not only had the chance to study cutting edge inference techniques, but also experienced the industry world as
            a Data Science intern at Google and collaborating with <a href="https://www.nccgroup.com/" target="_blank">NCC group</a>, investigating risks
            and limits of Deepfakes. A couple of years ago, I moved back to Italy to start my path outside of academia and I am currently working
            as a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.accenture.com/" target="_blank">Accenture</a>, as part of the Center for Advanced AI.

        <h2> Causal inference </h2>
            <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23564810_Causality_models_reasoning_and_inference_by_judea_pearl_cambridge_university_press_2000" target="_blank">
                <img src="https://www.pymc-marketing.io/en/latest/_images/causal_ladder.png" style="float:right" width="20%" height="20%"></img></a>
            <p>  Causal inference is the field of statistics and ML which aims to determine whether two or more 
                variables in a system are linked one to another by <b>cause-effect relationships</b>. Having an 
                understanding of the latter unlocks the possibility to produce interventional and, ultimately, 
                counterfactual scenarios that didn`t happen in reality (Pearl, Causality, 2009; Pearl and Mackenzie, 
                The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect, 2018).<br>
                Assume you have a Structural Causal Model (SCM), which is built on a causal 
                graph and causal mechanisms, namely either functional forms which describe the generative process of nodes given their progenitors
                or stochastic distributions for root nodes. In practice, producing interventional scenarios means responding to a question
                of the kind of 'What would happen if ..' (in the past if dealing with counterfactuals) by intervening on a node, 
                propagating changes through its successors, possibly resulting in a different system outcome. This makes
                causal inference key in those industries where there are considerable risks in providing certain treatments, as for 
                healthcare and finance.  <br>
                Despite being an extremely powerful tool, real-world data is often imperfect, subject to biases, 
                unmeasured confounding, and structural complexity, leading to possible threats to the reliability
                and robustness to this class of methods. Whether the causal graph is obtained from causal discovery, given the data at hand, or is defined 
                via domain knowledge only, ensuring the reliability of the framework starts with the validation of the graph, meaning it is 
                informative for the system and is representative for the data at hand. <br>
                <a href="https://www.pywhy.org/dowhy/v0.14/" target="_blank">DoWhy</a> is the python causal inference library I used 
                to build an inference framework targeting the cause-effect relationship between customer satisfaction and churn behaviour.
                In such a problem, where satisfaction is one of the most subjective data, ensuring a valid graph is certainly challenging.
        </p>

        <h2> Probabilistic regression </h2>
            <p> Traditionally, when dealing with a regression problem, the typical task is to provide a point estimate for each input, where a plethora of models is available, 
                from standard linear regression to tree-based algorithms. However, when dealing with real-world data, these point prediction hide an important aspect, which is 
                uncertainty. </p>

                <img src="https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/ngboost/blob/master/figures/toy.gif?raw=true" style="float:left" ></img></a>
            <p> To address the estimation of the latter, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03225">Duan et al. [2019]</a> developed the <b>Natural Gradient Boosting</b>
                algorithm (NGBoost), which aims to provide probabilistic prediction via gradient boosting. Having knowledge of the uncertainty in a regression model, enables better
                decision-making, which can be crucial when dealing with medical cases for instance. Their code is publicly available as a python library 
                (<a href="https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/ngboost">github repo</a>, from which the gif on the left was taken).</p>
            <p> During my internship, I had the chance to work with this kind of algorithms, developing extensions useful to the project I was assigned to. </p>

        <h2> Deepfakes </h2>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_autoencoder" target="_blank"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/VAE_Basic.png/425px-VAE_Basic.png" style="float:right"></a>
            <p>In recent year the diffusion of Machine-Learning had an incredible boost, reaching almost everyone: a well-known example are the social media 
                tools which allow to swap your face with someone or something else. These are an example of deepfakes, which in general generate realistic 
                synthetic images or masks representing our target in a new environment. Despite being funny when used to swap your face with your doggo,
                deepfakes pose a real thread as reported in numerous episodes, not limited to 
                <a href="https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-5-deepfake-scams-that-stormed-the-internet-this-year/">these</a>.

        <h2> PhD Thesis work </h2>
            <p> The development of robust inference frameworks is crucial to reliably improve our understanding of the standard cosmological model, 
                shedding light to open problems it currently suffers of. However, the increasing complexity of current analyses urged the need for 
                optimal data compression algorithms and alternative simulation-based Bayesian approaches, which development was boosted by Machine 
                Learning advances. My thesis work focuses on testing and applying these techniques to problems in the field of 
                gravitational waves and the Lyman-α forest, extended below.</p>

        <br>
        <h2> Quantifying information in compressed analyses of BAO </h2>
            <p> Over the last decades, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model" target="_blank">&Lambda;CDM model</a> 
                affirmed itself as a successful theory, able to descibe multiple cosmological 
                observations while modelling the Universe's dynamics and structure with only six parameters.
                With the advance of technology and instrumental power, there has been a boost in the quality of the data, tightening the constraints
                on these parameters, urging for testing standard inference analyses against systematics and loss of information.</p>
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08995.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="extras_/lya-corr.png" style="float:right"></a>
            <p> Amongst the diverse probes that can be used to constrain the &Lambda;CDM parameters, there is the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_acoustic_oscillations" target="_blank"> Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations</a> (BAO) scale, 
                which is detectable over 
                <a href="https://www.sdss4.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BAOdistanceladderwxi_scalefac.png" target="_blank">different tracers</a> 
                of the matter density field. Among them, there is the Lyman-&alpha; Forest, which is a sequence of absorption lines in high-redshift quasar
                spectra, caused by the neutral hydrogen distributed along the line of sight, between the quasar and the observer.
                Check out this <a href="https://youtu.be/6Bn7Ka0Tjjw" target="_blank">animation</a>!</p>
            <p> BAO produce a distinct peak feature in the correlation functions, as in the plot, which we can robustly use to probe the cosmological model. 
                Standard analyses of the Lyman-&alpha; correlation functions only consider the information carried by that peak. We conducted 
                two case studies. <br>
                The first one addresses whether this compression is sufficient to capture all the relevant cosmological information carried by 
                these functions, while performing a full shape analysis. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/518/2/2567/6827921" target="_blank">

                In the second study, we apply score compression on realistic Lyα correlation functions and explore some of its 
                outcomes, in cluding reliable covariance matrix estimation. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/528/2/2667/7515292" target="_blank">

        <h2> Simulation-based inference applied to gravitational waves </h2>
            <p> When constraining the values of the &Lambda;CDM parameters from observations, we rely on traditional Bayesian inference, which requires 
                the likelihood function to be analytically known. The likelihood is the probability of the data given a parameter value and the larger 
                the complexity of the problem the harder it is to compute this quantity accurately and fastly. In the case in which the likelihood 
                evaluation is significantly harder to compute, we can completely bypass it by  performing the inference in a framework in which the 
                likelihood is never explicitly calculated, but instead fit using forward simulations of the data. This is simulation-based inference. 
                A particular example is density-estimation SBI, in which a neural density estimators (NDEs) is trained to fit the joint parameter-data 
                space. For more details, check out this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.00007.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a>!</p>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cb/74/0a/cb740abb8e52e439049ee5b0d628a9b0.gif" style="float:left"></a>
            <p> Gravitational waves have proven to be powerful probes for tracing the evolution of the Universe expansion rate, but their constraining 
                power is reliable provided the analysis is free from systematics, which could arise from selection effects. In the traditional Bayesian 
                framework, accounting for these effects in the likelihood requires potentially costly and/or inaccurate processes. 
                In this paper, we use density-estimation SBI, coupled to neural-network-based data compression, to infer cosmological parameters from a 
                bayesian hierarchical model. We demonstrate that SBI yields statistically unbiased estimates of the cosmological parameters of interest. </p>

        <h2> Gaussian Processes </h2>
            <p> If case you don't know it already, our Universe is undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion! The physical mechanism that is causing it 
                still poses an open question and we generarically refer to it as Dark Energy. According to the &Lambda;CDM model mentioned above, this is 
                driven by Einstein's Cosmological Constant &Lambda;, which still raises theoretical questions that are far from clear. This, together with some 
                tensions between different probes, largely motivated the investigation of alternative models.</p>
            <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/gaussian_process.html" target="_blank"><img src="extras_/gp_sklearn.png" style="float:left"></a>
            <p> Theory provides a vast amount of Dark Energy models, but as of now there is no reason why you should prefer one alternative model over the other. 
                For this reason, we wish to place a constraint on Dark Energy in a model independent way. In particular, the dynamical contribution of the Dark 
                Energy to the Universe expansion is encoded into its equation of state. Hence, we wish to treat it as a free a function of time and 
                infer it from data in a non-parametric way. In this paper, we reconstructed the DE equation of state 
                by assuming an underlying gaussian process, fitting discrete inferred points.</p>
